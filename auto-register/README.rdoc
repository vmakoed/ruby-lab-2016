= Auto Register

== DESCRIPTION:

Registers a defined amount of users on http://site-maker.herokuapp.com/. My first attempts at BDD.

As one can tell from commits history, the project's original goal was to generate gog.com users. As it turned out, that
website is reCaptcha-protected against multiple registration attempts in a row from one IP. So the target was changed
to site-maker.
